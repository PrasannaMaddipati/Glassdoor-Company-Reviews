## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze topics in Glassdoor's employee reviews, in order to understand what employees like and dislike about their employers. To answer this question, I will need to accomplish a few things:
- Identify employers that have significantly high and low scores, and that have enough reviews to collect a large corpus.
- Collect employee review data for each of the employers that I have identified as a target for analysis.
- Analyze a corpus of employee feedback using Natural Language Processing techniques. Identify latent topics and their relative importances using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.
