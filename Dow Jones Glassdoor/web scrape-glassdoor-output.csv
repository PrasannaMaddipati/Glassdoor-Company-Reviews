"8"," Jul 24, 2008","""Low morale and no growth opportunity are not great benefits.""","2.0","Current Employee - Technical Consultant in Princeton Junction, Mercer, NJ","This company makes a good entry level, foot in the door type of position. The best reasons to work for Dow Jones are the benefits, however, the benefits deteriorate a little more each year so I am not sure how much longer this statement will hold true. It is a great place to meet and network with technical personnel. Unfortunately, the truly talented individuals aren't recognized and are either laid off or they find much better jobs elsewhere.","Dow Jones has been rapidly replacing loyal, talented and extremely knowledgeable people with overseas outsourcing companies. This pretty much eliminates the possibility of growth potential within the organization although management will try to convince you otherwise by saying the positions they are laying off are not management positions therefore you can still be promoted to management. The issue with this is that most technical people don't want to be managers, directors or supervisors, they want to be hands on technicians. This also works to the companies advantage because management levels and higher are not in the safety net of the union. By replacing most of the union employees, and therefore the union representatives, they are decreasing the effectiveness of the union which will in turn lead to contracts that are beneficial only to the company and not the few remaining employees. This leads to a quick deterioration of the ""great benefits"" that the company is known for.The other downside of IT at Dow Jones is the model in which they employ for their IT department. They employ a service oriented model where other departments have to go through a ridiculously complex process to order a particular service. There is no collaboration or working relationship between the requestor and the individuals fulfilling the request and you most likely won't get the same individual again for the next request. This also means that each group has a very specialized function and there is often contention with other groups who can provide the same function but can't since that function hasn't been assigned to their group. For example there is a team of corporate only system administrators who's only job is to build servers for corporate functions such as email. These sa's do not administer email or anything associated with email, their only role is to build and maintain the hardware and os on those corporate servers. Another group is not allowed to touch the hardware or os of that server in anyway, but they administer exchange on that server. So, if exchange hangs, they cannot reboot the server, they have to go through this ridiculously complex process to have the other system administrator reboot the server.This also explains why it is so easy for Dow Jones to outsource these individuals. These individuals didn't have any room for growth outside of their one specialized function assigned to their group.",2,8,2008,"Technical Consultant","Princeton Junction, Mercer, NJ","Current"

Too many of the wrong sorts of changes were made which--new CEO Will Lewis himself admitted, in his first London 'town hall'--were not the changes required and even then, went too far. These changes related to both the tone of the ethos which management objectified to employees, and perhaps more importantly a similar change in the ethos which was mediated to clients, subscribers and other types of customers [particularly on the institutional side.] There was an increase in inflexibility, imperiousness, distance [vis-vis internally, this was evidenced in an entirely new layer of middle management] a decrease in apparent fostering of internal mobility, decreases in emphatic meritocracy and an increase in cliquey types of overall corporate culture. It's true that these sorts of issues have always assailed all types of corporations everywhere, and perhaps more so in the last few years as a consequence of economic retrenchment, however, Dow Jones has clearly existed through dozens of economic downturns whilst managing to maintain both a beneficent air of independence, and abstraction from prevailing types of corporate cultures which are unlikely to foster impartiality as an end in itself.",1,249,2014,"Editor","London, England (UK)","Former"

Oh, and the last few months, our exit interviews have been conducted by an HR intern who has been with the company for 3 months. So I guess they know they're doing something wrong.

My colleagues were good. BUTThe hours were terribly long and the commute was horrible depending on which office you were going to. People worked 10 to 15 hours per day. I did not get to see my kids during the week. I worked on Sundays. Missed my kids school events during the week I never made it home in time for dinner.. even on Friday. There is no downtime. Marketing, sales, tech, all departments are in pretty bad shape (I got the same feedback from my colleagues in other departments). It's a dying business so I would really think 10 times before making a move here. Actually I would think a 100 times. If you think your current job is bad, I guarantee this is worse. I don't know why anybody would want to work here. You put in more hours than a start up or even more than your own small business. And you could get laid off at any point so keep that in mind (since the business is not booming as it once was). Tthat is especially true if you are in the newsroom. Benefits are good. You get three weeks of vacation and handful of personal days. The ""unlimited"" sick days are not real because you just work from home instead. I worked on vacation too. Again this is an accurate representation of my time with this company. I'm in a better place now I have more time with my family and less stress in my new job.

The WSJ and Fox News favor conservative politics, so be very careful about letting anyone know if you have liberal leaning political views.Rampant nepotism. The senior and middle management ranks are mostly UK expats that are close friends. This makes the culture very insular and cliquey. Most have little to no experience outside of News Corp and don't embrace outside experience. You will be intentionally excluded from information that can help you do your job and then be criticized that you didn't have the information.Autocratic management. The boss knows best is the primary management style. Best to keep your ideas and thoughts to yourself and do not challenge the status quo. You will be given little to no direction and insight to your job and managers are too busy to properly on board new employees. A lot of new employees are set up to fail and quickly become frustrated and disengaged.Excessive micromanagement and monitoring. It's common for managers to micromanage every aspect of a project and question every detail in private and in large meetings. Managers routinely monitor when you come in and leave and will openly question you about this. It's also common to receive weekend emails for menial reporting. The unspoken rule is that you be at your desk at 8:30 and don't leave before 6:00.Lack of privacy. The open office setting is on par with a new start up. You will sit at a very small desk without partitions and within two feet of co-workers on each side. This allows your manager to view everything you say and do all day long.Endless meetings. Expect to attend many 9am all hands meetings every week. If you're late you will be called out. You will spend at least 75% of your time going to status meetings to discuss the menial tasks. Managers often show up late and talk over for a half hour or more without any consideration for others.Low base pay compared to the industry. Expect that you will be low balled on your base salary which is typically 20 to 30% below what competitors pay.",8,575,2018,"Anonymous Employee","Not Given","Current"
